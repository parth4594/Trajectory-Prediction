# Trajectory Prediction #
Transformer Network to predict Trajectories for traffic agents

In realistic traffic scenarios, trajectory prediction is important to guarantee
the safety of an autonomous vehicle. To predict future trajectories,
interactions between surrounding traffic are needed to be modelled. While
modelling such interactions, the use of local semantic maps is helpful as it
determines the presence of obstacles and other surrounding traffic agents
in the traffic scene.

## Objectives ##
*Learning spatio-temporal relationships between the traffic agents to
improve prediction accuracy.
*Fusion of diverse data-types in the form of numerical data,
categorical data and local semantic maps.
